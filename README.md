## Using this repo
You can explore the 3D datasets in [webKnossos](https://webknossos.org/) following either of the links provided. No need to install anything. 

Clone this repository to your preferred location. 

You will need [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/store/) to run the analyses that recreate the figures.

Install the [warpAnnotations](https://github.com/FrancisCrickInstitute/warpAnnotations) toolbox to warp and analyse correlative multimodal annotations described in the paper.
